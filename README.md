# chromium-internals
Chromium Knowleg Forbidden for every one but public accessible :)

# IPC
Chromium is a distributed Platform so it has massiv IPC usage see: 
- https://github.com/tomer8007/chromium-ipc-sniffer as example 

on linux you can use also the pipes but i will not put documentation here. 
as rule of thumb if chrome runs as any user that has access to it's pipes.
